## Important Notice Regarding Installation

My current build (0.1.4) is running fine on an Oracle VirtualBox Ubuntu installation and Cubbli computer provided by the school.

When run through the VMware Horizon, poetry fails due to the "dev" group in pyproject.toml. If this error occurs, move the dependencies from dev group to the "regular" group.
