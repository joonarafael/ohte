## VERSIONS

Software has not been tested in a MacOS environment. Flag Quiz Game has been built with **Python 3.10** and **Poetry 1.4.0**. Software might not run on other versions. This installation guide [provides some possible solutions](./README.md#troubleshooting-some-possible-poetry-errors) for two common errors encountered with other Poetry versions. A solution for the SQLite error: `database is locked`, is also provied [down below](./README.md#software-test-coverage-report).

## INSTALLATION GUIDE

### 1. Clone this Github repository to your local machine by executing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joonarafael/ohte.git
```

### 2. Navigate to `./flaggame`.

[This folder](./flaggame/) is the root folder for the Poetry project. Not the Github repository `ohte` (where this `README.md` file is located in).

### 3. Resolve Poetry dependencies by executing:

```bash
poetry install
```

### TROUBLESHOOTING SOME POSSIBLE POETRY ERRORS

- **PROBLEM A**: *The Poetry configuration is invalid: Additional properties are not allowed ('group' was unexpected)*

  - **SOLUTION A**: This error occurs most likely due to mismatching Poetry editions. You can update your Poetry to 1.4.0 or alternatively manually edit the `pyproject.toml` at `./flaggame/pyproject.toml` by moving all developer dependencies to the "regular" group. You may also just remove them altogether if you don't need developer dependencies (e.g. pylint and pytest).

    ```bash
    nano pyproject.toml
    ```

- **PROBLEM B**: *The lock file is not compatible with the current version of Poetry. Upgrade Poetry to be able to read the lock file or, alternatively, regenerate the lock file with the poetry lock command.*

  - **SOLUTION B**: Your Poetry installation is too old/new. The original lock file has been generated with Poetry version 1.4.0. You can try to match your Poetry version, but this issue can also be resolved by first removing `poetry.lock` file at `./flaggame/poetry.lock` entirely, and then regenerating it again by executing:

    ```bash
    rm -r poetry.lock
    ```

    ```bash
    poetry lock --no-update
    ```

    This command regenerates the `poetry.lock` file for your system, compatible with your Poetry version, without changing the actual dependencies and their corresponding versions within the `pyproject.toml`.

### 4. Run the game in Poetry project master folder `./flaggame` by executing:

```bash
poetry run invoke start
```

Make sure to familiarize yourself with the [User Manual](./documentation/user_manual.md) and read the [rulebook](./flaggame/src/logs/gamerules.txt) to find details about all the different game modes!

## SOFTWARE TESTING WITH PYTEST

Run the tests, configured with [pytest.ini](./flaggame/pytest.ini) and ignoring all graphical user interface modules, by executing:

```bash
poetry run invoke test
```

Navigate to [this](./flaggame/src/tests/) folder to find all the automated test source files. The tests will take approximately 38 seconds. They are testing e.g. how the points awarding algorithms and statistics calculations work with different round times and scores. See [Software Testing](./documentation/software_testing.md) for a more complete document detailing the software testing process.

## SOFTWARE TEST COVERAGE REPORT

To generate the Coverage report (web browser version) for your local machine, execute:

```bash
poetry run invoke coverage-report
```

The generated report can be found at `./flaggame/htmlcov/index.html`.

Please note: if running the Coverage tool on a Horizon virtual desktop, execution might halt due to a SQLite error: `database is locked`. This is a direct consequence of the insufficient speed of the virtual disk (see [this page](https://ohjelmistotekniikka-hy.github.io/python/toteutus#sqlite-tietokanta-lukkiutuminen-virtuaality%C3%B6asemalla) for details). To fix this issue, the whole repository needs to be cloned in to the `/tmp` system folder for proper execution. Move to this folder and follow the instructions from the [beginning](./README.md#installation-guide) again.

```bash
cd /tmp
```

## PYLINT AUTOMATED CODE REVIEW

To run the automated code review algorithm with parameters defined in [pylintrc](./flaggame/.pylintrc), execute:

```bash
poetry run invoke lint
```

To read my personal notes about pylint results and other comments regarding software source code quality, see [Software Architecture](./documentation/architecture.md#remaining-issues-with-source-code-quality--software-logic).
