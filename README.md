# FLAG QUIZ GAME

current ver 0.2.0 (16.4.2023)
built with python3 poetry

## IMPORTANT NOTICES ABOUT INSTALLATION

- My current build (0.2.0) is running fine on an Oracle VirtualBox Ubuntu installation and Cubbli laptop provided by the school.

- Just running the game requires only the Pillow library. All other libraries are for dev group.

- 2to3 library has been added to the poetry dependicies due to weird errors I run into with autopep8.
